    <p> 
        Currently as it stands I am a computer engineering student at Kwame Nkrumah University Of Science and Technology(KNUST). 
        I would like to think of myself as a religious person seeing that God is the centre of life and the one who makes the impossible possible. 
        I am six(6) feet tall, I PASSIONATELY enjoy eating Jollof rice with chicken, I like watching movies most especially sci-fi movies seeing all those robots and advanced computerized systems just makes me excited.
        <br>
        Which brings me to why I chose to do computer engineering, I chose this programme because I felt it would give me a wide range of opportunities as it gives me a combine knowledge of computer science and electrical engineering making me quite versatile and more room for growth in any path I may chose to pick in the near future. 
        Which I feel like would be robotics but the future is yet to be exactly determined.
